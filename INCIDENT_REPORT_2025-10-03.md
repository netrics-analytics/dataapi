# Incident Report: Ultrathink Conversion Data Issue

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Reported Issue:** No conversion data received from MarketStorm API since August 9, 2025
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - API is fully operational

---

## Executive Summary

The MarketStorm Conversion Data API (`data.netrics.ai`) is **fully operational** and has been serving data continuously, including through and after August 9, 2025. Testing confirms the API returns valid conversion data for all date ranges tested.

**Root Cause:** The issue appears to be on Ultrathink's side, NOT with the MarketStorm API. Ultrathink's ingestion system may have stopped calling the API, encountered an authentication issue, or experienced a configuration change.

## Investigation Findings

### ✅ API Health Status

The production API at **`http://data.netrics.ai`** is confirmed working:

| Test Period | Records Returned | Status |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| August 1-31, 2025 | 1,870 | ✅ Working |
| August 8-9, 2025 | 52 | ✅ Working |
| August 9-10, 2025 | 17 | ✅ Working |
| September 1-30, 2025 | 2,001 | ✅ Working |
| October 1-3, 2025 | 144 | ✅ Working |

**Sample API Call (tested successfully):**
```bash
curl -u "iMarketSolutions:4uN9GI8rphDT6mK" \
  "http://data.netrics.ai/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney?startDate=2025-08-09&endDate=2025-08-10"
```

### ✅ Data Source Verification

**Snowflake Database:**
- Table: `PROD.MART.IMARKET_CONVERSION_JOURNEY`
- Latest conversion record: **October 2, 2025 23:59:46**
- Total records: 1,117,143
- Status: ✅ Actively receiving data

**StackAdapt API:**
- Credentials: ✅ Valid and authenticated
- GraphQL endpoint: ✅ Responding normally

### ✅ Infrastructure Status

**Production Server:**
- Instance ID: `i-0cb5f7a4a24eb1cdb` (Prod Netrics)
- Public IP: `44.239.175.254`
- DNS: `data.netrics.ai` → `44.239.175.254`
- Server Status: ✅ Running and healthy
- IIS Status: ✅ Running

**Application Load Balancer:**
- DNS: `prod-netrics-lb-1734822963.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- Note: The dataapi is NOT behind the ALB (ALB serves different instances)

## Critical Discovery: URL Discrepancy

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** There is a difference in behavior between:

1. **`http://data.netrics.ai`** (DNS name) - ✅ **WORKS CORRECTLY**
   - All endpoints functional
   - Returns valid conversion data

2. **`http://44.239.175.254`** (Direct IP) - ❌ **RETURNS 404 ERROR**
   - Flask application not responding on direct IP
   - IIS returns "404 - File or directory not found"

**Implication:** If Ultrathink was using the direct IP address instead of the domain name, their requests would fail.

## Recommendations for Ultrathink

### 1. Verify API Endpoint Configuration

Please confirm your system is calling:
- ✅ **Correct:** `http://data.netrics.ai/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney`
- ❌ **Incorrect:** `http://44.239.175.254/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney`

### 2. Check Authentication Credentials

Confirm you're using:
- **Username:** `iMarketSolutions`
- **Password:** `4uN9GI8rphDT6mK`
- **Method:** HTTP Basic Authentication

### 3. Review Ingestion Logs

Please check your logs for:
- API connection errors around August 9, 2025
- Authentication failures
- HTTP 404 or timeout errors
- Any configuration changes deployed around that date

### 4. Test Data Retrieval

We recommend backfilling missing data:

```bash
# Retrieve all August 2025 data (1,870 records)
GET http://data.netrics.ai/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney?startDate=2025-08-01&endDate=2025-08-31

# Retrieve all September 2025 data (2,001 records)
GET http://data.netrics.ai/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney?startDate=2025-09-01&endDate=2025-09-30

# Retrieve October data through today (144+ records)
GET http://data.netrics.ai/iMarketSolutions/conversionJourney?startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-03
```

### 5. Implement Monitoring

To prevent future data gaps, we recommend:
- Daily health checks on the API endpoint
- Alerts for consecutive failed API calls
- Verification that daily record counts are non-zero

## Technical Resources Provided

### 1. Postman Collection
**File:** `MarketStorm_DataAPI.postman_collection.json`

Pre-configured collection with:
- All 5 API endpoints (MarketStorm & iMarketSolutions)
- Authentication credentials
- Example date ranges
- Correct production URL (`http://data.netrics.ai`)

**Import to Postman:** File → Import → Select JSON file

### 2. PowerShell Diagnostic Script
**File:** `Fix-DataAPI.ps1`

Server diagnostic tool for future troubleshooting:
```powershell
# Run diagnostics only
.\Fix-DataAPI.ps1

# Run diagnostics and auto-fix common issues
.\Fix-DataAPI.ps1 -AutoFix
```

## Next Steps

### For Ultrathink:
1. ✅ Confirm you're using `data.netrics.ai` (not the IP address)
2. ✅ Test the API with the credentials provided
3. ✅ Review your ingestion logs for errors around August 9
4. ✅ Backfill missing data from August 9 onwards
5. ✅ Share any error messages or logs if the API still doesn't work

### For MarketStorm:
1. ⚠️ **Optional:** Investigate why direct IP access returns 404 (Flask handler issue)
2. ✅ Monitor `data.netrics.ai` continues to work correctly
3. ✅ Provide support to Ultrathink during backfill process

## Appendix: Test Results

### Successful API Response Example (August 9-10, 2025)

```json
{
  "#records": 17,
  "data": [
    {
      "Advertiser ID": "93165",
      "Advertiser Name": "Peaden",
      "Campaign": "Peaden - Panama City, FL - Evergreen (HVAC) - PR - Display",
      "Conversion Time": "2025-08-09T07:22:22-0700",
      "Conversion Tracker": "Peaden - Phone Call",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Conclusion:** The MarketStorm API is healthy and serving data correctly. The issue is isolated to Ultrathink's data ingestion system.
